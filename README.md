# SoloProject
 
## Final Year Solo Project
- Everything made by me other than models and meshes.


## CRPG Prototype
- Games like this have been a huge part of my childhood and some of the best games that I've ever played. I've always been interested in how they're made and how I could attempt to replicate them, this is my first attempt at doing so.

## Things included in this project
- Working character creation.
- Branching dialogue.
- Half working combat (Player and Enemies attack each other and will chase if attempting to run away)
- NPC's
- Camera control in the same aspect of the greats. i.e Baldur's Gate, Pillars of Eternity and Pathfinder.
- Ground loot (Quick Loot window, may add loot bags from slain enemies)


## To Do list
- Inventory System
- Finish Loot System
- Character Sheet screen
- Vertical Slice level (In Progress)
